Now that we have added atomic design principles to our app from yesterday AND now that we have completed the major functionality, it's time to add the final touches: Styling.

Utilize the design practices we've already implemented and update the components you see fit to be styled components. Once you have that completed, try to implement MaterialUI in some places. Something that is important to note is that MaterialUI isn't going to be used everywhere and in most cases styled components would be used instead, so it's incredibly important to become familiar with those.

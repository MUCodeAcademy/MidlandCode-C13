# Classwork

Let's think about what we've learned from today with atomic principles and see how we could apply them to the task application and keep working on that. In addition let's add more functionality:

1. Look at how you might want to separate out any existing components. Try to make them as small and granular as possible.
2. Start to think about how we could reuse some of our more atom sized components in different places throughout the application.
3. Try to add the ability to delete tasks

Functionality: 

1. Input box for a title and display that to the screen
2. Ability to add tasks
3. Ability to delete tasks
4. (optional) Ability to mark them as complete

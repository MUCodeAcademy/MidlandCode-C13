# The React Lifecycle

When a react component gets created (by the browser) and then re renders or changes, it follows a series of steps in order. This is the lifecycle. A diagram if it is as follow:

Let's take a look at how to create them, but first lets create a new application in React using the `create-react-app` CLI and talk through the folder structure.

# React with TypeScript

With the newer updates to the `create-react-app` package, you are able to create a React project directly in TypeScript. While this isn't required, it can be a great tool to help you keep track of your code and make sure you're using types whenever possible. There are some phenomenal resources available for learning TypeScript with React including [React TypeScript Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react#reacttypescript-cheatsheets).

# Other Tools

One great tool you can use to help troubleshoot issues is the React dev tools extension for chrome. It is great to look at components and props / state. While it is not used by everyone, it might be useful to take a look at if you're running into issues troubleshooting an application that compiled with no errors.

If you want to just play around with React without having to create a whole folder structure, there are some great resources here:

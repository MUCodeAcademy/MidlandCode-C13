# Classwork

We're going to create a very simple application with a few components. We're going to be using functional components, but think about how you might design it as a class component. You can also try to create it using TypeScript if you'd like. Remember, not all companies use TypeScript with React, but some do. Even if you don't end up using it, getting more practice with TypeScript is only going to help out in the future.

We'll be talking through actual interaction tomorrow, but for now familiarize yourself with the folder structure and main concepts.

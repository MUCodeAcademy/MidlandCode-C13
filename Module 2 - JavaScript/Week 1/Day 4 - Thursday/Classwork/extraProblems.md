# Extra LeetCode Problems if you want more practice

This is a list of LeetCode problems that you should be able to do with the knowledge you have now, however there are a lot of methods that we haven't learned yet, and those may be helpful to solve some of them (for example, the [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) method will probably be useful for some of these problems). Despite being labeled "easy", keep in mind that these questions are still quite difficult. Don't get discouraged if it takes you awhile to figure them out or if you have to look at the solutions.

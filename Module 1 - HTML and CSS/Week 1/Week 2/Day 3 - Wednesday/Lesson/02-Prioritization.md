# Work Prioritization and Compartmentalization

## Order of Work

- Research what you have to do and what techs you need.
- Break out dependencies. And then work forwards from least dependent.
- Know the scope and requirements of the project / end user.

## How to compartmentalize tons of work

- View what functionality you need from a base standpoint.
- Like with like, communication pieces together based off from and to the communication is happening.
- View language / framework / library differences and tackle those together if possible.
- View each large functionality as a puzzle try to find all of the differences. And follow DRY.
- Almost no such thing as pieces that are too small.

## Tools At Your Disposal

- Use Kanban / Trello / Whiteboard

# GitHub Pages

If you want to serve a static web page (or series of html files) you can use GitHub pages to do so. It is incredibly easy to setup.

Tutorial taken from: https://pages.github.com (you'll want to look at the instructions for "Project Site")

## Steps

1. Ensure that you have a repository where your html file(s) are located. The main file needs to be in the top level folder and not in a sub folder of some sorts.
2. The first page you want to load needs to be called `index.html`
3. From there, once all of your code is updated to your repository, navigate to your repository in a browser.
4. Click on the `Settings` tab at the top.
5. Click on Pages on the left
6. Under source, choose `master branch` and you should be good to go.
7. To access the website, go to `username.github.io/repository_name`

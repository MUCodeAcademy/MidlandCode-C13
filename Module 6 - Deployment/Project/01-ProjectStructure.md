# Final Group Project

## General Overview

The final project will consist of one single group and will mimic a real world environment including communicating with a client, meeting deadlines, and demoing completed steps to the client. You will be given feedback and answers to questions you have but only from the client's perspective as well as from the project manager's prospective.

## Team Structure

You will need to decide (as a group) on the following things:

- Tech Lead -
  - All technical problems should run through this person (in addition to team members)
  - They are the only ones who can seek help from instructors (explained more below)
- (Optional) Team Name - This can be anything that is work appropriate

## The Clients

For this project, you will be green-fielding a new project for a customer. This is going to simulate how things happen in the real world. Vague guidelines to begin with, non technical answers to questions, needs to change functionality without knowing necessarily anything about how to proceed.

## Project Process

### Starting Order

1. Select your Tech Lead and, optionally, your Team Name
2. Meet with the Clients to Determine their needs
   - ALL team members are encouraged to ask questions and take notes. This will reduce the amount of back and forth AFTER the meeting before you can get started.
   - Remember that the clients are the ones who make final decisions. They are also the ones "paying" you for your work and should be treated as such.
3. Discuss any potential snags or technologies needed to do the project.
4. Discuss your plan of attack by breaking out the project into user stories and assign first steps to each team member. You can use pair programming or individual work as you see fit. Remember you are going to be working off two day sprints (see schedule below) so make sure you are breaking things up accordingly.
5. Communicate with the client as to what they should expect at the next product demo.

### Project Schedule

Once you have the initial plan of attack you will be working off 3 day sprints to complete the project in demo-able chunks. You will be expected to demo these chunks to the clients and obtain feedback on how to proceed. Make sure that ANY guarantees you have given the client can be met and are not so small that the client will lose faith in your ability to meet the final deadline.

### Coding Help and Structure

You will have a github repository with the current code base already created for you and the entire team will be given access to it. ONLY the tech lead (and instructor) will have access to push to the main branch however. Any merges into main that need to be done will have to take the form of a pull request that only the tech lead can approve. This is to mirror the structure of a normal team where you would never be given access to the main branch.

The other major change from previous projects is how help will be given during the project. In order to also better simulate a real world team, you will be expected to work as a team to solve any tech problems that arise. If a problem arises that the entirety of the team cannot solve, the tech lead and ONLY the tech lead should then reach out to the instructor. If anyone outside of the tech lead for a team reaches out for assistance they will be directed back to the tech lead (with some exceptions). You will need to work as a team for this much like you would in the real world. Make sure you're selecting your tech lead to be the person you want to represent your team on any tech issues.

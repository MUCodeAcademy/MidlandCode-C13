# Classwork

## Middleware/Passwords

- Set up a middleware to log `Hi I'm a middleware` to the console every time a request is made to ANY route.
- Finally, take the Giphy app and have that be sent to the front end whenever `/app` is accessed.
- When the user enters their password, hash it.
- Make sure that any route not already declared is redirected to `/`.
- Separate out these files accordingly.

## Database

- Set up an example database with at least one table.
- Open a connection to that database in your backend.
- Get the table from the database using an SQL query.

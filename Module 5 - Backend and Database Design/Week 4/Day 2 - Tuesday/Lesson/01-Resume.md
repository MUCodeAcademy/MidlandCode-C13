# Resume Tips

## General

- Most recent and relevant experience goes towards the top.
- Try to make it one page. It's fine if it's one and a half, as long as the content is relevant and important.

## Projects

- Ideally have between 3-5 projects that you can list on your resume. These could be, for example, one of your personal projects, the Giphy App, and the final group project we do in class. 
- Give a brief description of what you did and why it's impressive. If possible, give a link to the website/Github respository.
- Be prepared to talk about those projects during a job interview. They might ask what some of the most challenging aspects of the project was, what you did to overcome them, or some technical specifics of the project.

## Education

- List any education you received. You don't have to go into detail, but the name of the school, field of study, and the year(s) you attended should be there.
- Having a college degree isn't too important in the field of computer science (even less so for web developers), but if you have a degree, make sure to list it either at the top or bottom of the resume. If it's not related to computer science, it probably shouldn't take up too much space on your resume, unless you're a Harvard graduate or something.

## Certificates

- Certificates are always helpful. If you have any, list the title, date awarded, and potentially the company you received it from.
- These can go towards the bottom.

## Skills

- Usually, a list of skills is put towards the bottom. Here are some example skills from this class that you can put in your resume:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - Node
    - React
    - Testing
    - MySQL
    - WebSockets
    - Git
    - Problem Solving

## Examples

I have two versions of my resume that you can look at for examples. I will link the downloadable files here so you can download them and fill them out with your own information if you want. I also have them as .pngs in this folder in case you want to look at those.

# C# and .NET

So you've probably heard a lot about how some places are looking for C# developers. They are, and contrary to what you might think, it's not super hard to pick up if you put the time in. Don't believe me? Take a look at the below and tell me what it does:

```c#
int i = 1;

switch (i)
{
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("One");
        break;
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine("Two");
        Console.WriteLine("Two");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Other");
        break;
}
```

So if you can pick up C# then you can take a look at [.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/build-dotnet-applications-csharp). An example application you can look at is [this](https://github.com/saiMedavarapu/Appointment-Scheduling)
